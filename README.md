## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Advanced Rhetorical Analysis**: Leverages a comprehensive, built-in **"Analyst's Lexicon"** to detect over 20 distinct patterns of manipulation, from simple guilt-tripping to complex socio-political rhetoric.
*   **Detailed, Actionable Reports**: Provides an AI-generated summary, highlights manipulative phrases directly in the source text, and offers clear explanations for each finding.
*   **Privacy-Focused**: Your text and API key are sent directly to the Google API. Your API key is stored securely and locally in your browser's storage and is **never** sent to any third-party servers.
*   **Multi-language Support**: The user interface is available in English, German, French, and Spanish out of the box.
*   **ü§ñ AI-Powered Language Management**: A unique feature that allows you to use the AI to translate the extension's entire interface into any language. Simply provide a language code (e.g., "it" for Italian), and the AI handles the rest. Custom languages are saved locally and can be deleted at any time.
*   **Seamless Integration**: Works as a Chrome Side Panel for easy access while you browse the web.

## üî¨ How It Works

The core of Athena is the **`ANALYST_LEXICON`**, a detailed, multi-section prompt that provides the AI with a framework for understanding manipulative language. This lexicon is an integral part of the system prompt sent to the Google Gemini API.

1.  When you submit a text for analysis, the extension sends it to the Google Gemini API along with the system prompt.
2.  This instructs the AI to act as an expert in linguistics, psychology, and rhetoric, and to use the lexicon to find matching patterns in your text.
3.  The Gemini API returns a structured JSON response containing the analysis.
4.  The extension then parses this JSON and renders the interactive, color-coded report you see in the side panel.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Usage

4.  Paste your key into the API key input field and click **"Save & Test Configuration"**. The extension will validate the key.
5.  Once the key is saved, paste any text you want to analyze into the text area and click **"Analyze Text"**.

## üìñ The Analyst's Lexicon

Athena identifies patterns based on a detailed lexicon, which is categorized into three main sections:

*   **Section 1: Interpersonal & Psychological Manipulation Tactics**
    *   *(e.g., Gaslighting, Guilt Tripping, Love Bombing, DARVO)*
*   **Section 2: Covert Aggression & Indirect Control**
    *   *(e.g., The Backhanded Compliment, Weaponized Incompetence, The Silent Treatment)*
*   **Section 3: Sociopolitical & Rhetorical Mechanisms of Control**
    *   *(e.g., The Straw Man Fallacy, The Co-optation of Dissent, Redefining the Terrain, Euphemism & Jargon)*
