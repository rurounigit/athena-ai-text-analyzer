## üî¨ How It Works

The core of HootSpot is the **`ANALYST_LEXICON`**, a detailed, multi-section prompt that provides the AI with a framework for understanding manipulative language. This lexicon is an integral part of the system prompt sent to the Google Gemini API.

1.  When you submit a text for analysis (either by right-clicking or pasting), the extension sends it to the Google Gemini API along with the system prompt.
2.  This instructs the AI to act as an expert in linguistics, psychology, and rhetoric, and to use the lexicon to find matching patterns in your text.
3.  The Gemini API returns a structured JSON response containing the analysis.
4.  The extension parses this JSON and renders an interactive, multi-part report in the side panel, including the summary, visual chart, and highlighted text.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Usage
