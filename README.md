## üî¨ How It Works

The core of Athena is the **`ANALYST_LEXICON`**, a detailed, multi-section prompt that provides the AI with a framework for understanding manipulative language. This lexicon is an integral part of the system prompt sent to the Google Gemini API.

1.  When you submit a text for analysis, the extension sends it to the Google Gemini API along with the system prompt.
2.  This instructs the AI to act as an expert in linguistics, psychology, and rhetoric, and to use the lexicon to find matching patterns in your text.
3.  The Gemini API returns a structured JSON response containing the analysis.
4.  The extension parses this JSON and renders an interactive, multi-part report in the side panel, including the summary, visual chart, and highlighted text.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Usage

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  Click the **Athena AI icon** in your Chrome toolbar to open the side panel.
2.  In the side panel, expand the **"Configuration"** section.
3.  You'll need a Google Gemini API key. You can get one for free from **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)**.
4.  Paste your key into the API key input field. You can also adjust the maximum character limit for analysis to control costs. Click **"Save & Test Configuration"**. The extension will validate the key.
5.  Once the key is saved, paste any text you want to analyze into the text area and click **"Analyze Text"**.
6.  Scroll down to review the generated report, complete with a visual profile, highlights, and explanations.

## üìñ The Analyst's Lexicon

Athena identifies patterns based on a detailed lexicon, which is categorized into three main sections. Each pattern in the lexicon is meticulously defined, complete with telltale signs, common phrases, and illustrative examples to ensure a high degree of analytical accuracy.

*   **Section 1: Interpersonal & Psychological Manipulation Tactics**
    *   *(e.g., Gaslighting, Guilt Tripping, Love Bombing, DARVO)*
*   **Section 2: Covert Aggression & Indirect Control**
    *   *(e.g., The Backhanded Compliment, Weaponized Incompetence, The Silent Treatment)*
*   **Section 3: Sociopolitical & Rhetorical Mechanisms of Control**
    *   *(e.g., The Straw Man Fallacy, The Co-optation of Dissent, Redefining the Terrain, Euphemism & Jargon)*
